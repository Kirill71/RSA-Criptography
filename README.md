# RSA-Criptography
My implementation of the RSA algorithm (training version as the encryption occurs on the numbers no more than 8 bytes), 
but fully functional.
Just use algortmy: Euclid's Algorithm (GCD), "a sieve" Sundorama, fast modular exponentiation. 
RSA algorithm is represented by a separate dynamic link library (there is also a project with the static version of the library).
